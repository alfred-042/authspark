# **App Name**: AuthSpark

## Core Features:

- Google OAuth Login: Enable users to log in using their Google accounts with a popup.
- Email/Password Login: Allow users to log in using email and password credentials.
- Email/Password Registration: Enable users to create new accounts using their email and password.
- Authentication State Management: Manage user authentication state to redirect to home page after successful login and redirect to login page if unauthenticated.
- Home Page Redirection: Redirect to the home page (home.html) upon successful authentication.
- Login Page Redirection: Redirect to the login page if the user is not authenticated and tries to access the home page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Netflix Red (#E50914) for a bold and recognizable feel.
- Background color: Black (#000000) to create a dark and immersive experience.
- Secondary color: Dark Gray (#222222) for UI elements and backgrounds.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for both headings and body text, due to its clean, modern, and neutral look.
- Use simple, filled icons in white or Netflix Red for authentication-related actions (e.g., lock for password, user for profile).
- Center-aligned layout for login and registration forms to provide a focused user experience.
- Subtle fade-in animations when transitioning between authentication states (login, registration, home).
